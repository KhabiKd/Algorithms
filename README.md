# Algorithms
 Here I will publish the algorithms I have analyzed. Kotlin.

1) Binary Search. 
   The essence of the algorithm is simple. The input is a **SORTED** list of elements. And each time we compare the middle element of the list with a hidden number. If the two numbers match, then the algorithm returns the position of the half element. If the hidden number is greater than half the element, we consider the same list, but its beginning is now equal to the position of the middle element + 1, if the hidden number is less than the average, then we do not touch the beginning of the list, but change the end to an index equal to the position of the middle element - 1

2) Selection Sort.
   The essence of the algorithm is as follows: first, create a function that returns the index of the smallest element in the array (we will use it in the sort function itself).
Sorting function: Each time we go through the list and look for the minimum (maximum, depending on the task) element and write it to a new list. At the same time, we remove this element from the old list. Selection sort has an easy algorithm, but a long time (increasing function of n^2 operations)

3) Recursion. Recursion function - a function that calls itself. Recursion allows the programmer to save time, that is, he does not have to write cycles. But there are cases when, due to recursion, the stack overflows or take up a lot of memory. Then you need to write cycles instead of recursion.

4) Quick Sort. Significantly faster than the selective sort algorithm. The essence of the algorithm: is based on recursion. The base case is an empty list or a list with one element, since they are already sorted. Next, the pivot element of the list is selected. And on the left side of it is a subarray with smaller elements, and on the right side with large ones. For these subarrays, quicksort is again used 

5) Hash Map. Ð¡ommonly used data structure. Stores pairs: key-value. Much faster than lists and arrays, returns any value by key almost instantly. However, there is also a worst case Hash map, when the number of collisions increases. In other words, several keys will correspond to one value, thereby slowing down the algorithm. Solution: increase the size of the array.

6) Breadth First Search. It all starts with creating a queue. The algorithm first checks the nearest neighbors to the original key. After bypassing all, the algorithm goes through all the neighbors of already checked neighbors. A new list is also created, where keys that have already been checked will fit.
